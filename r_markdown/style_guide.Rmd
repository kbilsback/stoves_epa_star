The purpose of this guide is to facilitate R programming consistancy in the project. This guide is based on [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). Originally authored by Nick Good (1/11/2017).

## Assignment

Use `<-` not `=`.

## Brackets

* curely brackets `{` should open on an existing line and close own a new line

```
 # good
  if(a < b){
 
  }else{

  }
```

* round brackets should open and close immediately before or after the code they enclose 

## Colors

* Plots colored by `ok`, `maybe` and `bad` should use:
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='markup', eval=FALSE}
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("ok" = "mediumaquamarine",
                                 "maybe" = "mediumorchid",
                                 "bad" = "mistyrose4"))
```

## Comments

Comments should be in lower case.

Comment according to the file type `.R` or `.Rmd`.

### Comments .R files

Try to describe the purpose of the code, avoid saying what the code is doing when it is obvious. 

Functions in `.R` files should begin and end with `#_____` at least as wide as the longest line of code. The function header should also include a`# consise description of purpose`, `# other information` and `# units` (no idention).

```
#____________________________________________
# load and organize smps data
# accepts data in tsi row-wise .csv format
# units embeded in file header
function_name <- function(){

}
#___________________________________________
```

Full line comments lines should begin with one space, a # and one space.

Comments after code should be preceded by two spaces, a # and one space.

```
  ug <- conc * flow  # convert to micrograms
  
 # output data in wide format
  out <- dplyr::select(var_1, var_2,) %>%
         tidyr::spread(var_1, var_2)
```

### Comments .Rmd files

Try to describe the code in the narrative text. Use inline comments sparely to clarify specific steps in the code.

## Empty lines

Add a line between lines with the following exceptions:

* below a comment line
* piped code
* repeated function call
* within a function call
* before a curely bracket

```
 # good
# comment
function(){

  load(data_1)
  load(data_2)
 
  ug <- data_1$flow * data_1$mass
 
  kg_per_kw <- ug / data_2$kw
 
  out <- dplyr::select(data_1, var_1, var_2) %>%
        dplyr::mutate(new_var = var_1 * var_2)
}

 # bad
# comment

function(){
 load(data_1)

 load(data_2)

 ug <- data_1$flow * data_1$mass
 kg_per_kw <- ug / data_2$kw
 out <- dplyr::select(data_1, var_1, var_2) %>%

        dplyr::mutate(new_var = var_1 * var_2)

}
```

## Function definitions

List arguments without default values should come first. Break line after comma if required.

```
# good
function_name <- function(val_1, val_2,
                          plot = TRUE)
                  
# bad
function_name <- function(val_1 = FALSE, val_2, plot =
                          TRUE)                      
```

## Indents

* Indent two spaces, except for function delcarations (incl. `}`) and function header and footer comments (never tab)

```
# good
function(var){
  
  new_var <- var*2
  
  return(new_var)
}

```

* align multiline functions and pipes with comparible code on the line above

```
 # good
  out <- dplyr::select(in, var_1, va_2) %>%
         dplyr::filter(var_1 > 10,
                       var_2 > 50)
```

## Libraries

Your first preference should be to use `tidyverse` packages. The current project `2017-01-11` contains legacy code e.g. `subset`, `merge`, `levels` etc which will be phased out.

## Line length

* Limit to 80 characters where possible

## Names

### Folder names

Folder names should comprise lowercase characters `[a-z]` with `_` as the separator. Folders containing `R` code and `R` output should be prefixed by `r_`. Folder names should concisely describe their contents.

### File names

File names should comprise lowercase characters `[a-z]` with `_` as the separator. File names should concisely describe their contents/purpose and end with the appropriate file extensione e.g. `.R`.

```
 # good
  style_guide.Rmd
  load_data.R

 # bad
  Test-A4-v7-finalv6.r
  some_code.r
```

### Object names

Object name should comprise lowercase alpha numeric characters `[a-z] [0-9]` with `_` as the separator. Object names should concisely describe their contents/purpose. 

* Function names should describe what the function does (verbs).

* Variable names should describe what the variable contains (nouns).

* Avoid using names of existing functions and variables

```
 # good
  pm25_data
  split_date_id_col

 # bad
  df (used in portion of existing code!)
  Run.Analysis
```

## Namespace

* Declare the namespace for non-base function

```
 # good
  dplyr::select(...)
  
 # bad
  lmer(...)
```

## Spaces

Place spaces around binary operators (e.g. =, +, -, <-)

```
# good
 mass <- conc * vol
```

No spaces around brackets

```
# good
 if(a > b){...
```
